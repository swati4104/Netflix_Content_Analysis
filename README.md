# 📊 Netflix Content Analysis – From Raw Data to Insights
🚀 Why I Built This Project

I wanted to understand how real-world datasets are cleaned and transformed before creating dashboards. So I chose the Netflix dataset and decided to perform the complete analysis process myself — starting from raw data to final visualization.

🧹 Step 1: Cleaning the Data (SQL)

The dataset had missing values and inconsistent formatting.

Using SQL, I:

Handled NULL values

Standardized date formats

Cleaned country and genre columns

Performed aggregations to explore patterns

This helped me understand the importance of preparing data before analysis.

📊 Step 2: Building the Dashboard (Power BI)

After cleaning the data, I imported it into Power BI where I:

Used Power Query for additional transformations

Created DAX measures for KPIs

Built interactive visualizations

Added slicers for dynamic filtering

📈 Key Insights Discovered

The United States contributes the highest number of titles.

TV-MA is the most frequent rating category.

Drama and International genres dominate the content library.

Movies slightly outnumber TV Shows.

💡 What This Project Taught Me

This project improved my understanding of:

End-to-end data analysis workflow

Writing efficient SQL queries

Creating dynamic KPIs using DAX

Designing clean, interactive dashboards

It gave me hands-on experience in turning raw data into meaningful insights.
